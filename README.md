# OOP Demo: A Java Game 🎮

Welcome to my Java Game project! This project is a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, featuring an interactive UI and real-time user control. It's a great example of my coding skills and my understanding of OOP concepts.

## 🌟 Features
- **Interactive UI:** Engage with the game through a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-Time User Control:** Experience real-time interaction and control within the game.
- **Dynamic Objects:** Interact with various dynamic objects within the game environment.
- **Enemy Collision Detection:** Experience real-time collision detection with enemies within the game.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java:** The project is entirely written in Java, showcasing proficiency in the language and its application in software development.
- **Processing Core Library:** Utilized for rendering graphics and enhancing the user interface.

## 📁 Project Structure
- **Player Class:** Manages player movement, displacement judgment, and collision detection with enemies. [View Player Class](https://github.com/samplecatalina/OOP-demo--A-Java-Game/blob/main/src/main/java/demolition/role/Player.java)
- **Main Class:** [View Main Class](https://github.com/samplecatalina/OOP-demo--A-Java-Game/blob/main/src/com/company/Main.java)
- **Game Class:** [View Game Class](https://github.com/samplecatalina/OOP-demo--A-Java-Game/blob/main/src/com/company/Game.java)

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Start the Game:** Follow the instructions to start the game.
2. **Control the Player:** Use the directional keys to move the player around.
3. **Avoid Enemies:** Navigate the player to avoid collision with enemies.
4. **Enjoy:** Have fun interacting with various elements within the game!

## 📈 Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Implementation of core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Java Programming:** Proficient use of Java for developing interactive and dynamic games.
- **Collision Detection:** Implementation of collision detection algorithms to enhance game interaction.
- **UI Design:** Creation of an interactive and user-friendly interface using the Processing Core Library.
